Some Notes,

  I could not get the app to display properly on smaller screen sizes such as the nexus 5.
  In particular the date field in View detail will get covered by the multiline text for
  item description. On Nexus 6, this issue is not there

  A negative counter is prohibited in my app. I am not sure if this was supposed to be
  but I assumed that negative items in real life does not make sense

  Thanks!
